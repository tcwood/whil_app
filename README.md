# Reddit Viewer for Whil

## Getting Started

Make sure you have npm and an ios simulator installed before doing the following

1. Clone this repo (run all of the indented commands in your terminal)
    1. git clone https://github.com/tcwood/whil_app.git
1. Go into the repo's directory 
    1. cd whil_app
1. Install the dependencies
    1. npm install
        - sit back and relax, this might take a little bit
1. Run the app on the simulator
    1. npm run ios
        - this also might take a little while if expo isn't already installed on your simulator
1. You should be good to go :)

The app should work on an Android simulator or through expo's app on mobile, but I haven't tested it yet.
- To try to run on an Android simulator, go into the cloned directory and run ==> npm run android
- To try to run on expo's app
    - Make sure you have expo's app installed on your ios or android phone (https://expo.io/)
    - go into the cloned directory and run ==> npm start
        - A QR code will show in your terminal. Use this in the expo app on your phone

Note: This app was developed using an iPhone 6 simulator. While it should run fine on other versions, some minor formatting might be off on other versions.

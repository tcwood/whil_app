# Reddit Viewer for Whil

## Getting Started

Make sure you have an npm and an ios simulator installed

1. Clone this repo (run all of the indented commands in your terminal)
    1. git clone https://github.com/tcwood/whil_app.git
1. Go into the repo's directory 
    1. cd whil_app
1. Run the app on the simulator
    1. npm run ios
1. You should be good to go :)
    

The app should work on an Android simulator or through expo's app on mobile, but I haven't tested it yet.
- To try to run on an Android simulator, go into the cloned directory and run ==> npm run android
- To try to run on expo's app
    - Make sure you have expo's app installed on your ios or android phone (https://expo.io/)
    - go into the cloned directory and run ==> npm start
        - A QR code will show in your terminal. Use this in the expo app on your phone
